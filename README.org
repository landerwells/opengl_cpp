** OpenGL Game Engine/Renderer
*** Goals
For this project I want to get a good grasp on graphics programming. I also want
to write a lot of C++ code. I am hoping to make a sort of isometric pixel art
game.

*** Build commands

#+begin_src bash
cmake -B build

cmake --build build

./build/opengl_cpp
#+end_src


*** Features
- Portals
- Gold in falling particle simulation?
  

*** Work on next
- [ ] Isometric set up
