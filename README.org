** OpenGL Game Engine/Renderer
Welcome! You found my little OpenGL project/renderer where I am experimenting
with graphics programming. I am hoping for this to be a small ECS engine to
learn. Otherwise I spend my time working on games in Bevy.

*** Build commands

#+begin_src bash
cmake -B build

cmake --build build

./build/opengl_cpp
#+end_src
