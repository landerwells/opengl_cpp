### Build commands
``` bash
cmake -B build

cmake --build build

./build/opengl_cpp

```

This repo isn't fully working. I just wanted to get this done in C++ and then
eventually move my skills to Rust.

For right now I just want to get the example up and running, and then I want to
make the C++ a bit more idiomatic and reasonable. Set things up for the rest of 
the OpenGL book and then move on to The Book of Shaders for a bit.

Features that I want to add
- Hot reloading shaders
