### Build commands
``` bash
cmake -B build

cmake --build build

./build/opengl_cpp

```

I have been thinking about where I want to take this project, and I believe I
will try to practice some more advanced lighting techniques like ray tracing.
That will be a solid enough project for me.

Features that I want to add
- Hot reloading shaders
